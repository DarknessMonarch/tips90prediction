          <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
          
          <h2>What makes Tips90Prediction different from other prediction sites?</h2>
          <p>
            <span>Answer:</span> Tips90Prediction stands out with our industry-leading 95% success rate on VIP predictions. 
            We combine advanced statistical models, expert analysis from former professional players, and comprehensive 
            research to deliver predictions you can trust. Unlike competitors who rely on basic statistics, we incorporate 
            real-time factors like team news, player conditions, and historical patterns that others miss.

          <h2>How do you achieve a 95% winning rate with your VIP predictions?</h2>
          <p>
            <span>Answer:</span> Our exceptional success rate comes from our unique three-tier verification system. 
            First, our statistical algorithms analyze thousands of data points. Second, our expert analysts with decades 
            of experience validate these selections. Finally, only predictions that pass our proprietary confidence threshold 
            make it to our VIP members. This rigorous process ensures only the highest-quality picks reach our premium subscribers.

          <h2>Can I access Tips90Prediction on mobile devices?</h2>
          <p>
            <span>Answer:</span> Absolutely! Our platform is fully optimized for all devices. We also offer a dedicated mobile 
            app for iOS and Android with exclusive features like instant notifications, quick-bet links to major bookmakers, and 
            a simplified interface for making decisions on the go. VIP members enjoy an ad-free experience across all platforms.
          </p>
          
          <h2>What payment methods do you accept for VIP subscriptions?</h2>
          <p>
            <span>Answer:</span> We accept all major credit/debit cards, PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and crypto payments 
            (Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT). All transactions are secured with bank-grade encryption. For your convenience, we 
            offer auto-renewal options that can be easily toggled on/off in your account settings.
          </p>
          
          <h2>What is your refund policy?</h2>
          <p>
            <span>Answer:</span> Due to the digital nature of our premium predictions, we do not offer refunds once tips have 
            been viewed. However, we stand behind our service quality with our Performance Guarantee: if our VIP tips fall below 
            85% accuracy in any month, we automatically extend your subscription by an additional week at no charge.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Is sports betting legal in my country/region?</h2>
          <p>
            <span>Answer:</span> Sports betting regulations vary significantly worldwide. While our prediction service is legal 
            to access globally, using these predictions for betting may be subject to local laws. We recommend checking your 
            local gambling regulations before placing bets. Tips90Prediction is an information service, and members are 
            responsible for ensuring compliance with their local laws.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Do you guarantee winnings with your predictions?</h2>
          <p>
            <span>Answer:</span> While our VIP predictions maintain an impressive 95% success rate, no prediction service can 
            guarantee wins on every selection. Sports inherently involve unpredictability. What we do guarantee is that our 
            predictions are based on thorough analysis, expert insights, and proven methodologies designed to give you a 
            significant edge over the average bettor and most bookmakers.
          </p>

            response within 5 minutes), email at support@tips90prediction.com (responses within 2 hours), and our dedicated 
            help center with comprehensive guides. VIP members get priority support with a guaranteed response time of under 
            30 minutes, plus access to our direct support line during peak betting hours.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Can I share my VIP subscription with friends?</h2>
          <p>
            <span>Answer:</span> VIP subscriptions are for individual use only and tied to your account. Sharing access 
            credentials violates our terms of service and may result in account termination without refund. However, we do 
            offer a Referral Program where you earn a 15% commission on friends&apos; subscriptions, plus both you and your friend 
            receive an additional week of VIP access when they sign up using your unique referral code.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Do you offer predictions for eSports and virtual sports?</h2>
          <p>
            <span>Answer:</span> Yes! We&apos;ve recently expanded to cover major eSports competitions including League of Legends, 
            CS:GO, Dota 2, and FIFA. Our specialized eSports analysts have backgrounds in professional gaming and understand 
            the unique factors that influence these events. Virtual sports predictions are available exclusively to Platinum 
            members as part of our complete betting advisory service.
