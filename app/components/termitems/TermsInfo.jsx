          <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            This Policy governs returns and refunds for the Premium subscription
            services on Tips90Prediction. By subscribing, you accept these terms.
          </p>

          <h2>No Refund Policy</h2>
          <p>
            Premium subscriptions provide access to exclusive sports predictions and
            content. All payments made to Tips90Prediction are non-refundable.
          </p>

          <h2>Quality Commitment</h2>
          <p>
            We strive to provide accurate predictions based on thorough analysis; however, 
            the dynamic nature of sports means outcomes cannot be guaranteed and are inherently unpredictable.
          </p>

          <h2>Subscription Cancellation</h2>
          <p>
            Subscriptions can be canceled at any time through your account settings, 
            but access continues until the current billing cycle ends. No partial refunds are issued.
          </p>

          <h2>Technical Issues</h2>
          <p>
            We address technical issues promptly to ensure uninterrupted service; however, temporary 
            service disruptions do not qualify for refunds due to the intangible nature of our predictions.
          </p>

          <h2>Subscription Modifications</h2>
          <p>
            Tips90Prediction may update subscription packages and offerings without entitling subscribers to
            refunds for fees already paid. We will notify users of significant changes.
          </p>

          <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
          <p>
            Disputes regarding subscription services are subject to arbitration
            and the jurisdiction outlined in our Terms of Use.
          </p>
